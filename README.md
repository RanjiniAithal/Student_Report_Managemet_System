Details

Student record management system is a simple software in which we can save record of the students. It is much easier than the traditional method of keeping student records. It is an application without graphics, and it is compiled in the code blocks with GCC compiler. Basic concepts of C like function, structures are used in this program.
It is important to use Management system as it is useful to sort and make it easier to search any record of the student in the list. Information about the students like full name,  address,date of birth, roll number can be added to the recor
d. All these details once saved can be searched, listed, and removed from the application. 
The homepage of the program will have basic functions of a student record such as 
•	Add details:       New student can be added with this.
                     It will collect details like name,address,roll number,date of birth.

                     their details.
